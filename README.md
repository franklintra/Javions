# Javions (jairplane)
This repository hosts the code of a first-year, second semester project at EPFL. The goal is to be able to ADS-B messages received by a SDR(software-defined radio) and to plot on a map the positions of the airplanes, while having the possibility to access more information similarly to how [flightradar](https://www.flightradar24.com/) does it.

## Environment Variables

As this project uses a software-defined radio provided by EPFL, in order to run it on your own computer, you will have to change the source of the ADS-B data, either using a public web sdr or your own radio.

`SDR_SOURCE`
